# AORTS Python Starter Kit

This is a starter kit for the 2019 AO RTS, built with Python. It includes:

 - a simple AI that randomly walks units around
 - a unit test setup with a couple examples

## Get Started

- Install Python 3.7.4
- Check out this repo, then open it in your favorite editor.
- You should be able to execute the code from the command line with "python3 main.py"

## What's next?

- Take a look at the UnitStrategyFactory.
- See if you can improve the exploration strategy! The random moves it's currently making are not a great way to explore the map.
- Try to collect resources to increase your score and ability to build units.
- Maybe create a strategy to build some units?
- Consider an offensive strategy! You can win by blowing up your opponent's base, or you can weaken your opponent by destroying their units.
